# 🏗️ AdventureWorks Data Engineering Project

This project showcases a modern data engineering pipeline using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** and **Azure Databricks** to process and analyze data from the AdventureWorks database.

---

## 📚 Overview

The AdventureWorks project leverages the strengths of ADF and Databricks:

- **ADF** handles **data orchestration**, ingestion, and scheduling.
- **Databricks** performs **data processing**, cleaning, transformation, and enrichment.

This setup enables a **scalable**, **cost-effective**, and **maintainable** workflow in the Azure ecosystem.

## 🧩 Pipeline Architecture

### 🔹 1. Data Ingestion & Orchestration (ADF)
- Orchestrates data movement from sources (e.g., SQL Server, APIs, files) to **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**.
- Stores raw data in the **Bronze Layer** (unprocessed zone).
- Triggers **Databricks notebooks** via scheduled or event-based pipelines.

### 🔹 2. Data Processing & Transformation (Databricks)
- Reads raw data from ADLS Bronze.
- Performs:
  - Data cleaning
  - Filtering & deduplication
  - Transformations using Python/Scala in notebooks
- Writes cleaned data to the **Silver Layer**.
- Optionally creates **Gold Layer** with business-ready aggregations and KPIs.

### 🔹 3. Data Warehousing & Analytics (Optional)
- Loads Silver/Gold layer data into **Azure Synapse Analytics** for reporting.
- Supports SQL queries via Synapse Serverless Pools or Dedicated SQL Pools.
- Enables BI dashboards using tools like Power BI.

## 🔄 Example Workflow

1. **ADF** copies AdventureWorks tables (from SQL Server) to **ADLS Bronze**.
2. **ADF** triggers a **Databricks notebook**:
   - Cleans & transforms data
   - Saves to **ADLS Silver**
3. Additional **Databricks notebook(s)**:
   - Create Gold layer metrics
4. Final data is loaded into **Azure Synapse** for analytics.

## 💡 Key Benefits of Using ADF + Databricks

| Feature | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **🔄 Scalability** | Automatically scales based on data size |
| **💸 Cost-Effective** | ADF is optimized for orchestration, Databricks for compute |
| **🧠 Separation of Concerns** | Clear division between movement (ADF) and transformation (Databricks) |
| **🔍 Monitoring** | Centralized pipeline monitoring in ADF |
| **⚙️ Modularity** | Easy to manage, test, and extend |
